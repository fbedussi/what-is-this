//Order of rules
//All you need to do is find the call-site and inspect it to see which rule applies. But, what if the call-site has multiple eligible rules? The order of precedence to these rules (from lowest to highest priority) is:

//1. Default binding
//2. Implicit binding
//3. Explicit binding
//4. `new` Binding
